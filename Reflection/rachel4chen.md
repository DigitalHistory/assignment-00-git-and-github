# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out relfection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In a time when data is so readily available due to the web and artifacts are better preserved due to better technology, a major part of a digital historianâ€™s job is compiling information and making it more accessible, rather than finding data and artifacts. The flipping card layout could be utilized as a way to connect collaborative databases. For example, museums often have massive archives of similar objects and it is not always easy to compare objects from a distance, but shipping objects is expensive. On a website, each card could show a type of object, and the card could lead to websites dedicated to that kind of object. Rather than sift through websites on their own to see what other museums have, archivists could simply flip through a visual catalogue to reach the relevant database. From there, they can collaborate with other researchers studying the same type of object.


## Question 2
#### With each card representing a type of object, the separate fields should give more description about what makes the objects distinct such as possible usages or their countries of origin. For example, pottery is a common artifact, but there are different types of pottery. While the image might indicate a bowl, the separate fields would describe what researchers think that type of bowl was used for. This is limited of course, as different people would likely have different theories about similar objects, or objects that have similar uses might not look similar enough for a researcher to make the connection merely by looking at the card format in order to properly categorize an object. With that limitation, the intended collaboration goal is mitigated because there is no way to reconcile an object that fits multiple databases, such as in the case that an object matches separate images and descriptions.
