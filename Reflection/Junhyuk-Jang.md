# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out relfection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.

One way to utilize the layout is to make an index page for an encyclopedia in which it contains historical figures, events, and places for Canadian histories. While the index contains only the brief information about the subject, such as name, date (of birth) and the place (of birth), if clicked, the users can access much detailed information about the subject. The way to organize the index page can be anything from alphabetical order to date to subjects. For the subjects, one index page can be categorized under multiple subjects. If systematically possible, it would be nice to add a search or filter function so that users could choose certain time period or subjects depending on their research topics. It would be also important to list related readings in the detailed page so that users could easily navigate through related articles without having to look up the index. 

## Question 2
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

As an index page, it is best to keep it as simple as possible. For people, full name including titles, if the person has one, date of birth and date of death should be included. For events, name of the event (put one name even if it has multiple names), start date of the event, and end date of the event should be included. For place, name of the place, and the location of the place including the name of the country should be included. One possible obstacle of this data structure is that it limits the amount of information for each record. This index page will only be helpful for those who know what to look for, since the index does not give much information about each record. The users always have to get to the detail section (the substitute for GitHub and Email button in this context) in order to decide if the record is relevant to his or her research topics and whether the contents of the record is academically significant enough.
