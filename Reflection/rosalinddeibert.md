# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out relfection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.
This layout could be used to create flipping card profiles of historical figures. This could be used in making education of history for children or high school students fun and easier to read and understand. By making flipping cards with information and facts about the historical figure, it is easier to read and likely will be more fun for the user than simply reading a paragraph of information. This may help the learners remember what they are studying better, and help them to get to know each of the historical figures and what they have done, rather than simply memorizing statements of information. The image on the card may also be useful as the combination of information and an image might help make this more interesting and easier to read for the user.


## Question 2
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?
In the example I provided above, using flipping card profiles of historical figures as a means of education for children, it would depend on what type of historical figures the users are being educated about. For example, if the flipping card profiles are being used to teach the history of 19th century philosophy, cards might include birth and death, branch of philosophy, most important works, major philosophical ideas, influences, country where the philosopher lived, and an image of the philosopher. The flipping cards in this case might include philosophers such as Mill, Kierkegaard and Marx.
