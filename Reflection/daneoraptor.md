# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.

A simple way of using this method that would be helpful for historians or humanists is compiling a list of historical figures, events, and/or places that would be easily accessible by students, other historians, or even the general public.  After all, one of my biggest projects in high school was creating profiles of historical figures in a format similar to this.  It would be useful for studying and can even hold information such as readings about or by the figure, event, or place that redirect students and historians alike to places where they can learn more about these things.

My own, more original idea would be to use this format to track historians themselves and the projects they are undertaking.  The flipping cards could be used to hold a short blurb about the historian and their research, and then links to their publications.  If I were to complicate things, perhaps there could be a search or filter function that allowed others to sort historians by topic and/or time period so as to gather certain information from a certain time.


## Question 2
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

I'm going to discuss my more original idea about having profiles of historians.  Public fields that would need to be provided are:
First name and last name, so as to find them by name.
Birthday and Death date, so as to find out the time period when they wrote.
Place or places lived, so as to know where they wrote.
Topic of research, so so as to easily find authors for a certain field of research.
Readings/research, which can be a list of readings accessible by other historians.
A blurb, a one or two sentence summary about the historian and their impact/research.
An image, so as to know what they looked like.

This structure feels limiting because I feel that these cards are meant to hold only a basic summary, and providing so much information may make a website or card feel crowded and inaccessible.  In a way, it might be easier to go to places like wikipedia, which has similar information, though of course, it may not be accurate.  For instance, while one would be able to know where a person lived previously, I did not provide a field to figure out when they lived in these places, which may change the context of a historian's writing.  I believe that the data structure does not allow for a lot of information to be shown or accessed, so my idea might not even fully work.
