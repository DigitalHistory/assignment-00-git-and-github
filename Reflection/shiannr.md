# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out relfection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.

This basic layout can be used for multiple purposes, especially from a historian’s perspective. The concept of flipping cards would be useful when dealing with dates and information of important events that have happened in the past. For example, they can be categorized and used to identify key individuals in specific events. Historians will benefit from having organized flipping cards with relevant information to their research. If my research was to be on World War 2, then I would use the idea of flipping cards to have a picture as well as important information on significant figures pertaining to my research.


## Question 2
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

In the case of the second world war, the idea of flipping cards can be used to identify important Nazi officials, with their birth and death dates, name, their position in the Nazi Regime. This will allow for a more organized and efficient method of finding out information. One of the limitations is that if the focus is on Nazi officials from the regime, some of the officials will have far less information available on them. Furthermore, there were many other aspects to the second world war and attempting to provide them all through flipping cards would be an issue. Therefore, making multiple websites with this concept would be a more structures way of conducting research. This has the potential to become a tedious task and might be difficult to keep track of if there are multiple websites with this layout, however if organized in a way that suits the historian’s way of working, then it would be an extremely helpful and powerful method of research.
