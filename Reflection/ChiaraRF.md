# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.

An online tool with this kind of layout would be extremely useful for presenting a variety of information about historical sites or figures. One specific example of this would be to create a database of memorial sites dedicated to an event such as the Great Famine in Ireland for use in a study of how we remember this and similar tragedies or for making the results of such a study accessible.

## Question 2
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

In this example, each record would need to include a number of specific fields including the name of the memorial, its location, the year that it was erected, whether it is extant or historical, a brief description of the site and a picture if one is available. These details are particularly important in exploring memory as they allow the historian to determine patterns relating to when and where the event is memorialized as well as which aspects were chosen to be representative. Other fields which might be useful to consider would include who erected the memorial - government, community groups or individuals for instance - and how it was received.

While this format would certainly provide an excellent overview of vital facts concerning the subject, it also has its limitations. As a result of the flashcard style set-up of the website, the information delivered would need to be concise so as not to clutter up the user interface or induce information overload. While this is not necessarily a major issue when looking at broad patterns, it could be problematic if further site-specific details are required. It might, however, be circumvented in some part by building in the ability to flip the card over and provide additional information on the “back” or by linking to more in-depth pages.
