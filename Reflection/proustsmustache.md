# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out relfection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.

As a student of Sanskrit, I think that this layout would be useful for memorizing declensions and tense conjugations. Often in “standardized” classical languages such as Sanskrit, noun declensions and tense conjugations (past, present, gerund, gerundive, periphrastic perfect, etc.) both follow a common pattern that one needs to memorize and then apply to all the nouns with the same ending and verb roots. Such a layout that involves cards can be helpful for studying and memorizing these grammatical “rules”, as two people can test each other with one of them scrolling through the cards and calling out a tense/declension to see if the other guessed the  pattern correctly until they have committed it to memory. While I used Sanskrit as an example for this, I think that such a tool would be useful for the study of all classical and modern languages which follow a standardized set of grammatical rules.

## Question 2
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

First, for tense conjugations, each card would correspond to a tense ((past, future, gerund, gerundive, periphrastic perfect, etc.). Necessary fields for each of these cards would be “conjugation rule #1”, “conjugation rule #2”, etc. until the finite verb form is reached, and then a small “example of tense conjugation” at the end in order to illustrate how the verb is to be conjugated. For example, in the case of the tense conjugation for gerunds/absolutives (depending on which grammatical school you follow) it would look a little something like this:

“conjugation rule #1”: “no prefix: root+tva”
“example #1”: “/śru = śrutva”

“conjugation rule #2”: “upasarga: root+ya (tya if ends in short vowel)” ”
“example #2”: “ni/han = nihatya”

In the case of declension, the card would correspond to a noun “ending” (a, ā, i, ī, u, ū, e, and ai, consonantal, etc.) and it would follow more systematic table-like approach which would list the cases (“nominative”, “objective”, “instrumental”, “dative”, “ablative”, “genitive”, “locative”, and “vocative”). Within each of these “fields”, there would be three corresponding declensions (singular, dual, plural), and so it would end up looking something like this:

“nominative”: “puruṣah puruṣau puruṣāh”
“objective”: “puruṣam puruṣau puruṣān”
"instrumental”: “puruṣena puruṣābhyam puruṣabhiḥ”

One limitation that I can think of (and anticipate) is how well the script (in both Latinised diacritical form as well as the Devanagari script) would adjust to the web page and coding software as they both require very specific fonts. These scripts are vital to understanding the difference between words which may appear the same in standard script form (es es es vs. es eś eṣ). Furthermore, the Devanagari script would be vital as it would familiarize students with how the declensions and conjugations would actually look in a Sanskrit text. A standard font for the script would be necessary.
