## Question 1
#### A more interesting use of the basic layout used in this project that serves a pedagogical purpose would be to use the cards to organize factors and underlying issues that contribute to historical phenomena. For example, when trying to organize the causes of the first world war, a notoriously difficult subject to teach to students with no prior knowledge, the layout would allow a visually effective yet simple and easy to understand format for introducing the various complex contributing factors in the war's breakout, such as imperialism and nationalism. The format is also versatile enough that it can be used to study the same subject from a number of angles, utilizing the same underlying visual structure that students can easily become accustomed to.


## Question 2
#### The main fields that would need to be provided would be the name of the issue, the historical events and concepts that contributed to its existence, the main states and individuals involved, policies that were causes and effects of these issues, and how they relate to the central event. One potential limitation that the use of this data structure imposes on this use is that some causes of complex events such as; to use my previous example, the breakout of the first world war, require more detailed discussions that may be difficult to summarize in a single field while still maintaining the short card format. Another limitation is that the fields imply that the information discussed is relevant seperated from information presented in other fields, which is problematic for the purpose of the project as many of the information necessary to discuss in a complex historical issue like the first world war relate to each other in complex ways that might be difficult to present in these separate fields.
