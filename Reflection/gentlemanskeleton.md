# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out relfection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.
Using the card template for this assignment, the theme is useful as an introduction to how the digital world could be used to make information public. In this case, the class roster could be created into a website where people can learn about our classmates.

In a teaching or research approach to the card layout, a different theme could be use instead of a class roster such as "France's Kings". These cards have a lot of similarities to trading cards where there's a picture, name and information on its characteristics. However, the "trading card" format will be beneficial from a teaching perspective. Interesting details about each king would be presented on the cards along with resources where people could find more detailed information. The primary purpose of the cards are a re-direct for more information on historical figures towards existing literature while attempting to interest the reader with the character's presented on the cards.

## Question 2
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?


The problem with the card format is that they lack the space for in-depth knowledge on the Kings. If you made all the card's large, they would not be cards anymore since a card should be relatively small and not overwhelm the reader with information. However, since links can be imbedded within the text of the card, this could be used to an advantage to keep the card concise while providing the reader with resources to learn more about the kings.

Therefore, instead of "powers" an easy thing to add would be a list of accomplishments or travesties related to the King's rule to interest the viewer. These events would be connected to a Wikipedia article or similar database so the reader could be more informed on the event itself if the viewer does not have the interest in delving too far into the life of the King.  

 Instead of "Academic interests" the best thing would be for a list of books related to the King so the reader could be moved on to continue learning about the King rather then just receive "bite sized information". The books would be hyperlinked to a place where they'd be sold such as Amazon.

 The limitation of having the cards as a redirect for further information is that people will not learn much from the card itself. While the accomplishments section would attempt to interest the reader to learn more, it might not be enough. However, if the reader is interested based on the accomplishments, the existing literature section will provide the resources that the reader can use thus, the cards would be a success. Furthermore, general information would be on the card such as Name, title (instead of nickname like "The Great") and years in power.
