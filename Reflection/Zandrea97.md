# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out relfection on the assignment.

### Question 1
#####For this assignment, we collectively constructed a small website composed of info-cards for each member of the class. Apart from being a fun way to introduce and familiarize myself with classmates, I also think this kind of website would be useful for facilitating accessible research for historians who are looking for fellow scholars to inform their work. For example, an issue that I encounter when starting research is finding authors that write about the topic I am interested in. To solve this problem, I would slightly modify this basic layout and separate the pages around particular topics, potentially starting with geographical areas and time periods. Within these tabs, cards would hold the profiles of historians and scholars with their areas of research, contact (if still alive), and publications. A research portal like this would not only be useful for students, it could also be a resource for networking as well.  



### Question 2
##### The fields that I would need to provide for each record within the context of my project would be: First name; Last name; Email (if still alive); Topics of Research; and Publications. One of the main limitations that come from using this kind of data structure is that it forces topics to exist within generic boxes, which may not account for the complexities that often come with areas of research. Boiling down a researcher’s work into four or five words would most definitively not encompass the context in which the research is being done, what the person’s background with the research is, and how each topic is connected and fits within the field. Because of this limitation, I see this project as a launching pad for research, rather than a one-stop portal for the entire academic process. This obstacle comes with the limitation of having to keep all the information in small cards, which requires a neat, minimal, and accessibly amount of information that can be understood easily.
