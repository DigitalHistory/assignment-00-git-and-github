# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists. 

Since this layout is easy to understand and utilizes a basic format to relay visual and textual information; it can be re-purposed in any number of different ways. It could be used in a purely textual form to introduce concepts, with a title, definition and examples listed on the card in a brief and concise manner, helpful as a visual aid to remember important information, especially in studying. It could also be used to link people, places, and objects to relevant information about them to create a web of larger concepts, useful as a learning and/or teaching tool.


## Question 2
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

In the example I mentioned above about linking objects, places, or figures to key concepts, this structured card format might not be so useful as it relies on the use of headers or categories to sort different types of information. This information may not always necessarily belong to only one category within the card, and if repeated to emphasize this, runs the risk of providing irrelevant information, and not serving the purpose of being concise and easy to understand. This type of format could be too structured in this case, and also doesn't provide enough creativity to link these cards to one another, or re-arrange information in the case of using these to learn about or organize larger concepts and ideas.
