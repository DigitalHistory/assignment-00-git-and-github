# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.
A website composed of flipping cards could be used to provide important information on key figures in history for pedagogical uses in younger classrooms--a picture accompanied by key accomplishments, contributions, or actions when said figure was alive. It would serve as a useful visual tool in classrooms as well as a study tool for assessments. The flipping cards are similar to physical flash cards one might use for learning or studying and so the website could be used in the same kind of way. In addition to key figures, one might choose to add flipping cards of various events in a history, key moments, places, or objects along with the information to go along with each topic.

## Question 2
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?
For the use above of displaying key figures, moments, events, places or objects in history, the fields that would need to be provided could range from firstname, lastname, birthdate, deathdate, importance, accomplishments, contributions, actions, etc. A limitation of such discrete units of information, or categories of information, is that the resulting information displayed would end up reducing complex historical arguments into oversimplified data. One might choose to add more lengthy and complex information but this would come at the cost of a simple and accessible layout and prevent the use of the flipping cards as simple learning and study tools.
