# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out relfection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.
Each flipping card can represent a period of time that allow users to search and filter through different time periods. The cards contain data such as start and end year of a time period, major events that occured in a time period, significant figures, location(s) etc. Each piece of data contained on the cards can be a hyperlink to a wikipedia page or a library catalog page. A web design with this kind of functionality is a fun and interesting way to engage students into history and hopefully spark an interest into studying one of these time periods more throuoghly. It is especially good considering we live in a genration that is dominated by the hyperlink and the way we read and understand information is changing and evolving.


## Question 2
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?
As described in question one, the fields provided in each record would be start and end year of a time period, major events that occured in a time period, significant figures, and location(s). The limitation to this kind of data structure is that it makes filtering for a set of related things difficult. For example, in this assignment we specified super powers and its possible that many of us have similar super powers but the way we described those super powers are different. If student X described their super power as "firepower", student Y described their super power as "pyrokinesis" and firepower is the same as saying pyrokinesis, then student X and student Y have the same super power. However, there is not a shared keyword between these two super powers that make it easy to find both student X and student Y.
