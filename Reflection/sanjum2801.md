# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### A possible alternative use, which would be helpful for historical research, could be using the format of the flipping cards for finding information about historical figures. This use would be particularly relevant for historians wishing to look at lesser-known figures. For example, if someone wanted to look at worker's rights in Victorian England, the flipping cards could be of workers for whom we have biographies, autobiographies, or other works available, along with biographical information such as date of birth and gender to allow for easy finding of relevant figures for the research.


## Question 2
#### Some fields would be name, date of birth and date of death, location in England, gender, brief biographical notes (eg information about whether they were part of worker's movements, died in an accident, etc), a field for an image of the worker if available or else of the source material, and, for links to other pages (in our case the email and github fields), a record to the source material if online or to a catalogue record if only available in print, probably labelled with the name of the source or with "catalogue record". Some limitations of this would be that only a limited catalogue record could be obtained--many books are not listed in a full catalogue record of every library listing in the world, so using this for archival research might require limiting it to, for example, the British Library or holdings on a particular continent. Another limitation would be that only a small amount of information can ultimately be presented, so that if someone is looking for specific info eg everyone involved in a specific incident or those who were orphaned as children etc. it would perhaps not be useful for them--so the webpage would be for more general searching only.
