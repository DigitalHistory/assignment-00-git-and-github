# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out relfection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.

Each flip card will represent an event in history. The flip cards are ordered by date and each card has some correlation to the next. For example, each card is the next event that was triggered from the previous card. Each will have basic information about the event. As you scroll through the website, you are going through a quick summary of a specific timeline in history. (ex. the events that led to WWII, etc.). People will be able to view and understand what events influenced what in a specific timeline. People can also click on each card to learn in detail about the event itself. This will be a creative way to teach and view history from another perspective.



## Question 2
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

The fields that are required are:
- 'Event Name' - identify the event.
- 'Event Time' - identify the time in history.
- 'Event Description' - describe what happened during that event.
- 'Cause of Event' - reasons why this event occurred. This would be links to previous cards (since the cards are going to be in order). 
- 'People Involved in the Event' - influencers of the event.
- 'Impact of Event' explain the importance of the event and include the links to the cards that were impacted by this event.

The limitations are the complex events. Summarizing the event description and the impact of the event could be challenging to fit in the limited space in the cards. A solution could be a preview or an interesting caption to draw people to click on the card to read the full information.
