Reflection
Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

Question 1
In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. 
Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve 
some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.

The flipping card layout could be used in digital archives and collections to present snapshots of 
key information to users. For example, an art gallery or museum might display on its website key objects
and artifacts by providing images and description without overwhelming the audience with information.
This would especially be useful in advertising an exhibition and encouraging audiences to visit in person.  
Likewise, digital archives could display their objects online in a way that allows users to access only the
information they need. 
 
Question 2
Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of
information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to 
provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of 
data structure imposes on your project?

In the example of digital archives using the flipping card layout, some fields might include image, 
artist/creator, date, location, a brief description, series, and identification number. The fields for art gallery
or museum websites might be limited to artist/creator, date, and materials used. A limitation of this data structure 
is that while it allows audiences to quickly access a number of objects, the information presented is limited in depth.
It could be difficult for a user to understand the contexts in which the object was created, interpreted and preserved.
